            <h1>Nutrient Dynamics in the Tampa Bay Watershed</h1>
            <p>
              Tampa bay is a diverse area ranging from a dense urban downtown to suburban and resort locations. This development diversity requires Tampa to have equally intricate legislation to maintain the quality of the watershed it resides in. Quite often the bay and beaches are subject to massive algal blooms, some more toxic than others. As tourism is a major economic factor in the city, government officials recognize this and attempt to maintain levels of water quality that result in these blooms. Starting at the residential level the use of fertilizers is banned during the rainy season from June 1st to September 30th (Hillsborough County, 2018). This ban is helpful as it reduces the non-point source pollution into the bay area. However, the effects of the ban are minimal. Studies show that 32% of the nitrogen that is released into the bay comes from runoff of residential fertilizers. If a complete ban of residential fertilizer use were enacted this could result in a major increase in water quality. However due to public pushback the current legislature only prevents approximately %4 of current nitrogen release annually. While seemingly miniscule this 4% adds up to 84 tons of fertilizer annually (T, 2009).  EPA’s Clean water act is the first line of defense in the industrial battle for cleaner water. Recognising that nutrient overload has far reaching effects on the environment and consequently public health numerical limits are established to prevent eutrophication in many waterways with 10 μg/L to 40 μg/L for phosphorus and 2 mg/L to 6 mg/L for nitrogen being acceptable (P, 2013). The main culprit of the water quality crisis is not the residential population but industrial agriculture. Accounting for 78% of all phosphorus entering the bay, over 5 ½ times as much as natural sources. Phosphorus availability is often the limiting factor in algal growth just before nitrogen (Company, 2020). The recently passed The Clean Waterways Act aimed at reducing the flow of phosphorus into our environment. This act while a step in the right direction is hollow in its effect. The farmers are encouraged to perform best practice land management but they are not monitored so it is simply in good faith. Most farmers see tighter regulations as detrimental to their livelihood so virtually none follow regulation. Aside from residential and agricultural sources, Tampa also has a unique fertilizer industry resulting in by-products that have no permanent disposal. These by-products are Phosphogypsum (PG) and waste water from the chemical processes that concentrate the mined material into fertilizers. PG is stored in stacks near processing plants; low levels of uranium and thorium in PG make it too radioactive for use near populations. Recovery of these metals is also not economically viable as uranium prices have collapsed after Fukushima. While relatively well monitored by the EPA the stacks are not a large source of runoff to the ecosystem however the storage ponds of the wastewater are. The recent disaster at Piney Point is such an example. Although waste waters are much more dilute than their product the sheer quantity makes these ponds a large reservoir of phosphorus. Small amounts are released into the ecosystem without much harm however, the disaster is the equivalent of a year's worth of nutrients in a single event. There is a distinct lack of monitoring and management of these sites as ownership is private and proper CERCLA management is impossible. The industrial accumulation of these nutrients can prove devastating on local ecosystems. While most see these accumulation areas as negative, the potential to inspire natural growth is almost unlimited. Bioremediation techniques implemented south of lake Okeechobee are mostly successful in utilizing excess nutrients for growth. If best practice management of these ponds were enforced these waste products could be used to help stimulate the growth of created wetlands.

              While being a hotspot for reclamation and rehabilitation Florida legislation has many shortfalls, lax monitoring and enforcement makes agricultural and residential legislation nearly ineffective. While similar neglect results in the eventual disaster on the industrial level. Economics and enforcement seem to be the leading cause of the main culprit. Encouraging the recovery of uranium from PG stacks could eliminate them, and by-products could be used for power and construction aggregate. Secondly enforcing a residential fertilizer ban would dramatically help the nitrogen levels of the bay. Enforcement of best practice land management would also reduce agricultural runoff. Southern Florida has the potential to make its waters clean however more sustainable practices need to be enforced although they can be costly, the long term environmental damage is infinitely more expensive.
